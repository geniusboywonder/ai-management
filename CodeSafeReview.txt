I want to put in some failsafes when generating code with Claude, since I am often hitting message and token limits.

Would the following code protocol help? Make any adjustments to optimise it for writing code with Claude

Edit
Looking at your checkpointing protocol, it's a solid foundation but needs some adjustments to work optimally with Claude. Let me break this down:

Current Protocol Assessment
Strengths:

Incremental saving concept is excellent
Versioning with timestamps prevents overwrites
Focus on preventing code loss is crucial
Issues for Claude optimization:

The ---SAVE FILE:--- format won't actually save files (Claude can't write to your disk)
500-1000 line chunks are too large for most Claude responses
Missing integration with Claude's artifact system
Doesn't account for Claude's inability to see previous conversation context
Optimized Protocol for Claude
Here's a revised approach that works with Claude's capabilities:

Core Strategy:
Use artifacts as your primary checkpointing mechanism
Break work into smaller, logical chunks (100-300 lines max)
Create explicit handoff instructions for continuation
Build in recovery mechanisms for interrupted sessions
Recommended Workflow:
1. Initial Planning Phase

Start each coding session by asking Claude to create a detailed plan
Request a modular breakdown of the codebase
Ask for dependency mapping between components
2. Incremental Development

Request one complete, functional module per response
Each artifact should be self-contained and testable
Include clear "next steps" at the end of each response
3. Checkpointing Format Instead of file saves, use:

Artifacts for current working code
Explicit status summaries ("Completed: X, Y, Z. Next: A, B, C")
Dependency lists for each component
4. Session Recovery When resuming, provide Claude with:

Previous artifacts (copy/paste the code)
Status summary from last session
Specific next task to continue
Would you like me to create a more detailed implementation guide, or do you want to test this approach with a specific coding project first?
