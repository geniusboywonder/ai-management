## clear context and background information

co-ordinating multi-step tasks with AI web agents can be complex and sometime agents can "run-away" with the whole project and not check in frequently and even drift away from the prompt.

## specific role assignment

An AI agent, who understands how the chat/prompt-response process works, as well as how ai agents operate in the background.

## explicit goals and objectives

- I need a better way to manage the "flow" of working with agents, across multiple sessions and with multiple agents. I was thinking about specific protocols that can be attached to a prompt to help keep the agent on track.
- scan github and other leading AI websites to find best practise, protocols and other ideas on how to manage AI agents. Look out for are Coding Protocols, Chat-specific protocols, Workflow protocols and methods to track progress of complex multi-step agent tasks easier.
- derive an indication of how well established and used each of these is. look at indicators like date added, last update, likes, stars, clones, branches, upvotes, users, downloads etc.
- I am open to other suggestions on how to manage this.

## format preferences tone and style guidance

Summarise the findings into a table available for download as an md document. Include a link to the advice, a summary of what it does and the derived indictor.

## any specific exclusions or limitations

This applies to web UI agents (and not API based work for now)

"After every action, summarize what was done and ask for permission to continue."
ASk questions to clarify annd remove any ambiguity in the task. Always state your assumptions

"You are an AI assistant working on a multi-step task. Follow this protocol:

1. **Plan**: Break the goal into clear steps.
2. **Act**: Perform one step at a time.
3. **Report**: After each step, summarize:
   - What was done
   - What was learned
   - What the next step should be
4. **Wait**: Ask me "May I proceed to the next step?" before continuing.
5. **Verify**: If uncertain, ask for clarification.

Never proceed without my confirmation. Let's begin."

Additional Suggestions
Use Versioned Prompts: Save prompt versions per session to track evolution.
Session Notes: Maintain a shared log (e.g., Notion, Obsidian) where agents append summaries.
Timeboxing: Limit agents to 3â€“5 steps per session to avoid fatigue and drift.
Agent Roles: Assign roles (e.g., Researcher, Reviewer, Editor) and use role-specific prompts.
