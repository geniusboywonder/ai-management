You will be writing large code files that may exceed message limits.  
Please follow the checkpoint protocol:  
- Save progress in <10k char chunks using `_WIP_vN` filenames.  
- Always output the full cumulative file, not just the new part.  
- Use the marker:  
  ---SAVE FILE: filename_WIP_vN.ext---  
  <code block>  
- After saving, give a short progress summary and clear resume instructions.  
- On a new response, reload the latest WIP and continue seamlessly.  
- When done, rename the latest WIP to the final file name.
